todo:
    implement workspaces

convert layout engine into a trait? use trait object to generate layout?
(this would allow users to define their own special layouts, but would probably cause lifetime issues)

Implement multihead via randr
Implement mapping windows and mapping policy
Implement config and use it
Add method to get layout type -> dependent on xrandr
finalise cursor methods
integrate logging API
implement api-agnostic pointer/button event mask for XConn
implement Debug properly for user-facing types
make Layout more user-friendly (see penrose)
add hooks to allow users to modfify a client before it is mapped
