todo:
    implement workspaces

convert layout engine into a trait? use trait object to generate layout?
(this would allow users to define their own special layouts, but would probably cause lifetime issues)

Write tests for getting window properties
Implement mapping windows and mapping policy
Implement config and use it
Add method to get layout type -> dependent on xrandr
finalise cursor methods
integrate logging API
implement api-agnostic pointer/button event mask for XConn
implement Debug properly for user-facing types
make Layout more user-friendly (see penrose)
add hooks to allow users to modfify a client before it is mapped
figure out restarting in-place

cool stuff to add:
- Reading window layout from serialized data


(refer to rcwm todo for additional stuff lol)
