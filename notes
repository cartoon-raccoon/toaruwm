todo:
    implement workspaces

convert layout engine into a trait? use trait object to generate layout?
(this would allow users to define their own special layouts, but would probably cause lifetime issues)

implement parsing WM_HINTS and WM_SIZE_HINTS from property data (src/x/xcb/xconn.rs)
finish implementing XConn for XCBConn (src/x/xcb/xconn.rs)
finalise cursor methods

learn randr methods
add multiscreen support (randr)
figure out restarting in-place

(refer to rcwm todo for additional stuff lol)
